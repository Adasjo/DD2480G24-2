# DD2480G24: CI


## Github Webhooks
This implementation utilises several webhooks for different purposes, such as handling issue creation and pull requests. 
Currently, the CI server implementation is hosted locally and consequently all internet traffic is tunneled through [ngrok](https://ngrok.com). Any given Webhook in this project has the following characteristics:
- `Payload URL`: The forwarding URL provided by `ngrok`
- `Secret`: Secret message for validation of payload authenticity
- `Content type`: application/json
- `SSL verification`: Enable SSL verification
- `Events`: The event handled by the Webhook
